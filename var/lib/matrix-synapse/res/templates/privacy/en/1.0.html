    <h1>Understand how your data is used</h1>
    <p>
        The Matrix protocol is designed with your privacy and data 
sovereignty in mind. Because it is a decentralised, federated service 
with cryptographically-validated message integrity, there are a few 
important things to know before you use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Matrix Service <a href="https://matrix.envs.net/">https://matrix.envs.net</a> is run and managed by envs.net.<br>
        The Homeserver Name is: <code>envs.net</code>
    </p>
    <h2>Federation</h2>
    <p>
        Services using the Matrix protocol rely on Matrix homeservers 
which share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When you send messages or files in a room, a copy of the 
data is sent to all participants in the room. If these participants are 
registered on remote homeservers, your username, display name, messages 
and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will forget your copy of your data upon your request. We 
will also forward your request onto federated homeservers. However - 
these homeservers are outside our span of control, so we cannot 
guarantee they will forget your data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Federated homeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bridging</h2>
    <p>
        Some Matrix rooms are bridged to third-party services, such as 
IRC networks, twitter or email. When a room has been bridged, your 
messages and media may be copied onto the bridged service.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It may not be technically possible to support your 
management of your data once it has been copied onto a bridged service.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Integration Services (Bots and Widgets)</h3>
    <p>
        The envs.net homeserver provides a range of integrations in the 
form of Widgets (web applications accessed as part of the Matrix Client 
webapp) and Bots (automated participants in rooms). Bots and Widgets 
have access to the messages and files in rooms in which they 
participate.
    </p>
    <h2>Forgetting your Data</h2>
    <p>
        You can request that we forget your data if you deactivate your 
account.  Each user in a Matrix conversation receives their own copy of 
all messages and files in that conversation (similar to email), so we 
ensure data is forgotten by ensuring that your data is not shared 
further and is not visible to future users.  Once all usersâ€™ copies have
 been forgotten the messages and files will be deleted from the envs.net
 homeserver database. For full details, please see the <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/privacy-notice/" target="_blank">full privacy notice</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you remove (redact) a message, the message content will no 
longer be accessible to users. Redactions only remove message content, 
your display name and avatar - your username will still be visible. 
Federated homeservers and some matrix clients may not honour the 
redaction request.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any of the above are unacceptable to you, <b>please do not use the Service.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
